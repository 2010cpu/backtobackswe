/*
  "Online" algorithms are those that can process input piece-by-piece
  instead of getting the whole input all at once to create an output from.

  In this problem we are asked to create a structure that allows to know
  the live median of an incoming sequence of data.

  The full data stream is not known all at once and we must optimize for an
  asymptotically fast median read time at all points in the data stream
  being sent to us.
