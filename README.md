# Back To Back SWE

An initiative to empower the software engineer to excel in the interview.

<b>The Exhaustive Topics A Software Engineer Needs To Know To Pass A Big N Interview:</b>
- Fundamentals of Computer Systems (just a general knowing how computers store information etc.)
- Big O Time & Space Complexity Computation
- Arrays
- Primitives
- Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion / Backtracking
- Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashtables
- Linked Lists
- Sorting
- Searching
- Min/Max Heaps
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees, Binary Trees, & Binary Search Trees
- System and OO design Principles (sometimes)

And that is pretty much it. These are the topics you need to know well to pass.

The channel's goal is to contribute to the community of people bridging
these topics to help engineers excel in the interview.

I am only a humble teacher, I am not perfect.

If even one person gets an offer from my work my day is complete.

## Missing Code

If I am missing code for any videos that you'd like to see, open a Github issue and I will make sure that I get to putting up a well commented code sample. (I know many of the beginning videos do not have code samples and need to go back and amend this)

## Best Books For Prep

<b>Bare Beginner:</b> https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850
<b>Medium/Advanced:</b> https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272
<b>Advanced:</b> https://cses.fi/book/

My Comments: Cracking The Coding Interview is a good start but pales in comparison to how much Elements
of Programming Interviews (EPI) will prepare you for the interview. Everything that I do has been inspired
by this book. To date, I have read it nearly 5 times and skimmed it 4 times.
